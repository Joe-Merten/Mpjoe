Frage f√ºr Stackoverflow vorbereitet ...

Whats seems to be the best Java audio library for a media player application?

Some years ago, I'd developed a media player (similar to DJ Maze's [mp3tunes](http://www.in.com/downloads/softwares--mp3-tunes-46853.html)) using Borland Delphi 7 and 
[FMOD](http://www.fmod.com) for audio mixing and output (after leaving [Xaudio](http://www.xaudio.com) because of license issues).

Now I'm going to start a new project from the scratch which shoud support at least:

* Ubuntu / Kubuntu (maybe some more linux platforms
* Android
* Maybe Windows
* Maybe later Mac OSX and iOS
* I think, I should use different audio libs for the different platforms (at least for Linux versus Android), isn't it?

Features for audio playback:

* Audio formats at least:
  * mp3
  * ogg vorbis
  * flac
  * Maybe wav
  * Maybe later Midi playback
* Multiple simultaneous players (for crossfading, jingles, et cetera)
* Support of multiple outputs (e.g. for headphone pre-listening / pre-cuing while playlist goes to the master output)
* Pitch control
* Equalizer feature would be nice
* Visualization interface (for implementing e.g. VU Meter / wave) would also be nice
